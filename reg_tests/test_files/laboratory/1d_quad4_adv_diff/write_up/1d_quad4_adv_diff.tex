\section{Introduction}
This case provides a description for one-dimensional time advancement
of a passive scalar, i.e., constant velocity, whose partial differential
equation (PDE) includes the effects of advection and diffusion.

\section{Domain}
The simple two-dimensional geometry for this tutorial is captured in 
Figure~\ref{fig:geom} where the key length of the domain is unity.

The left and right surfaces are periodic while all other surfaces are zero flux. 
A constant velocity of $u_x = 1$ is applied to the scalar transport equation. A
viscosity, $\nu$, is specified to be 0.01, resulting in a Peclet number of 100 based on the 
domain length and unity based on the local mesh spacing ($Pe = U L/\nu$). The initial condition 
is simply a Gaussian distribution, see /src/user\_functions/ScalarGaussianAuxFunction.C.

\section{Theory}
The time varying transport of scalar $\phi$ is given by,

\begin{align}
  \frac {\partial \phi }{\partial t} + u_j \frac{ \partial \phi }{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial q_j}{\partial x_j} = 0,
\label{eq:contEq}
\end{align} 
where $q_j$ is the diffusive flux given by,

\begin{align}
  q_j = -\nu \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_j}.
\label{eq:momEq}
\end{align}

\subsection{Simulation Specification and Results}

The mesh exercised activates a Hex8 topology, thereby exercising a
linear basis that yields a nominal second-order spatial accurate
simulation. A BDF2 three state scheme is applied for a fully implicit
evolution. The simulation can be extended in time. The periodic domain
mimics and infinately long domain.

\section{Discussion Points}

There are several interesting activities associated with this sample case including
the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Explore the mesh and input file specifications associated with this case.
	\item Explore the specification of viscosity: increasing and decreasing the nominal value by 10x. 
          What do you see?
        \item The current advection operator is specified as "scs\_upw\_advection\_np''. What happens if you
          activate "scs\_advection\_np'', again in the context of modification of the viscosity by 10x?
        \item What happens when viscosity is set to zero?
        \item Based on what you have learned in class, what is the controlling numerical principle?
\end{itemize}
