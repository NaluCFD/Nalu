Neutral Atmospheric Boundary Layer Case

30 Nov 2017

This case is an example for running a large-eddy simulation of a neutral-
stability atmospheric boundary layer.  The mesh resolution is much coarser 
than would be run in practice, but that can be easily changed for a real 
case.  The case should be run for at least 16,000 s to acheive a level
of quasi equlibrium.  We recommend running this case with 10 m uniform
resolution in all directions (it is set up for uniform 40 m resolution
for this regression test).  The stability is neutral with no heat flux
at the ground, but the boundary layer is capped with a stable inversion
layer.  Because of constant density used here, because we do not include
pressure work term in the enthalpy equation, and becuase we use Boussinesq
buoyancy, temperature is potential temperature.

- To build the mesh, use NaluWindUtils abl_mesh with nalu_abl_mesh.yaml
- To initialze the fiels, use NaluWindUtils nalu_preprocess with 
  nalu_preprocess.yaml

Domain: 
  - x: 0 m - 5000 m
  - y: 0 m - 5000 m
  - z: 0 m - 1000 m
  - periodic laterally

Winds:
  - specified 8 m/s from 245 degrees (southwest) enforced with a
    P-controlled driving source term.

Initial temperature profile:
  - 300 K constant to 650 m
  - linear varying 300 K - 308 K from 650 m - 750 m
  - linear increasing at a rate of 3 K per 1000 m above 750 m

Initial velocity:
  - Constant 8 m/s from 245 degrees throughout with sinusoidal
    perturbations near the surface

Surface:
  - Rough wall shear stress model based on Monin-Obukhov similarity.
  - z0 = 0.2 m
  - qWall = 0 W/m^2

Upper Boundary:
  - Symmetry for momentum (effectively a no-stress lid).
  - Heat flux to maintain a specified temperature gradient

Coriolis:
  - Coriolis terms to account for Earth's rotation at 45 degrees
    north latitude

Bouyancy:
  - Density is set to constant
  - Boussinesq bouyancy in z-momentum 

SGS model:
  - one-equation subgrid-scale turbulent kinetic energy with 
    buoyancy source term.  Model constants are set to work well
    with ABL applications.

Other:
  - Reference pressure: 101325 Pa
  - Reference temperature: 300 K
  - Reference density: 1.178037 kg/m^3 (ideal gas based on 
    reference pressure gives this rho_ref = p_ref/((R/mw)*T_ref)
  - Viscosity: 1.2E-5 kg/m-s
