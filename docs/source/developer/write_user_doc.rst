Writing User Documentation
==========================

This documentation is written in Sphinx and is generated automatically
on the `http://nalu.readthedocs.io <http://nalu.readthedocs.io>`__ 
website every time the `Nalu Github repo <https://github.com/nalucfd/nalu>`__ is updated. 
This documentation can also be built locally on your machine 
by using the instructions `here <build_doc.html>`__. Sphinx uses 
restructured text (RST) to generate the documentation in many other 
formats, such as this html version. Refer to the primer on writing 
restructured text `here <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`__.
