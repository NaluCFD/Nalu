Writing Developer Documentation
===============================

Developer documentation should be written using Doxygen annotations 
directly in the source code.  This allows the documentation to 
live with the code essentially as comments that Doxygen is able to extract
automatically into a more human readable form. The manual for Doxygen exists 
`here <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/index.html>`__.

Doxygen has a huge amount of functionality and can get quite verbose 
in the source code if you are not careful. You can also refer to 
the :nalu:`example.h` to see some examples of 
how you can write Doxygen annotations in the code. Also note the link 
to :nalu:`example.h` is a functionality provided by Doxylink in which 
you can refer to the code directly from this Sphinx-generated 
documentation.
