Sierra Low Mach Module: Nalu - Theory Manual
============================================

The SIERRA Low Mach Module: Nalu (henceforth referred to as Nalu), developed at Sandia National Labs, represents a generalized unstructured, massively parallel, variable density turbulent flow capability designed for energy applications. This code base began as an effort to prototype Sierra Toolkit, :cite:`Edwards:2010`, usage along with direct parallel matrix assembly to the Trilinos, :cite:`Heroux:2003`, Epetra and Tpetra data structure. However, the simulation tool has evolved as a tool to support a variety of research projects germane to the energy sector including wind aerodynamic prediction and traditional gas-phase combustion applications.
