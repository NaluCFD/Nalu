Nalu Input File
---------------

Nalu requires the user to provide an input file, in YAML format, during
invocation at the command line using the :option:`naluX -i` flag. By default,
:program:`naluX` will look for :file:`nalu.i` in the current working directory
to determine the mesh file as well as the run setup for execution. A sample
:download:`nalu.i` is shown below:

.. literalinclude:: nalu.i
   :language: yaml
   :caption: Sample Nalu input file for the Heat Conduction problem
   :emphasize-lines: 6, 11, 21, 91

Nalu input file contains the following top-level sections that describe the
simulation to be executed.

**Realms**

  Realms describe the computational domain (via mesh input files) and the set of
  physics equations (Low-Mach Navier-Stokes, Heat Conduction, etc.) that are
  solved over this particular domain. The list can contain multiple
  computational domains (*realms*) that use different meshes as well as solve
  different sets of physics equations and interact via *solution transfer*. This
  section also contains information regarding the initial and boundary
  conditions, solution output and restart options, the linear solvers used to
  solve the linear system of equations, and solution options that govern the
  discretization of the equation set.

  A special case of a realm instance is the input-output realm; this realm type
  does not solve any physics equations, but instead serves one of the following
  purposes:

    - provide time-varying boundary conditions to one or more boundaries within
      one or more of the participating realms in the simulations. In this
      context, it acts as an *input* realm.

    - extract a subset of data for output at a different frequency from the
      other realms. In this context, it acts as an *output* realm.

  Inclusion of an input/output realm will require the user to provide the
  additional :inpfile:`transfers` section in the Nalu input file that defines
  the solution fields that are transferred between the realms. See
  :ref:`nalu_inp_realm` for detailed documentation on all Realm options.

**Linear Solvers**

  This section configures the solvers and preconditioners used to solve the
  resulting linear system of equations within Nalu. The linear system
  convergence tolerance and other controls are set here and can be used with
  multiple systems across different realms. See :ref:`nalu_inp_linear_solvers`
  for more details.

**Time Integrators**

  This section configures the time integration scheme used (first/second order
  in time), the duration of simulation, fixed or adaptive timestepping based on
  Courant number constraints, etc. Each time integration section in this list
  can accept one or more :inpfile:`realms` that are integrated in time using
  that specific time integration scheme. See :ref:`nalu_inp_time_integrators`
  for complete documentation of all time integration options available in Nalu.

**Transfers**

  An optional section that defines one or more solution transfer definitions
  between the participating :inpfile:`realms` during the simulation. Each
  transfer definition provides a mapping of the to and from realm, part, and the
  solution field that must be transferred at every timestep during the
  simulation. See :ref:`nalu_inp_transfers` section for complete documentation of
  all transfer options available in Nalu.

**Simulations**

  Simulations provides the top-level architecture that orchestrates the
  time-stepping across all the realms and the required equation sets.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. inpfile:: Time_Integrators

   A list of time-integration options used to advance the :inpfile:`realms` in
   time. Each list entry must contain a YAML mapping with the key indicating the
   type of time integrator. Currently only one option,
   ``StandardTimeIntegrator`` is available.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      Time_Integrators:

   timesteps have been completed. If both :inpfile:`time_int.termination_time`
   and this parameter are provided then this parameter will prevail.

.. inpfile:: time_int.time_step

   The time step (:math:`\Delta t`) used for the simulation. If
   :inpfile:`time_int.time_stepping_type` is ``fixed`` this value does not
   change during the simulation.

.. inpfile:: time_int.start_time

   The starting timestep counter for a new simulation. See :inpfile:`restart`
   for restarting from a previous simulation.

.. inpfile:: time_int.second_order_accuracy

   A boolean flag indicating whether second-order time integration scheme is
   activated. Default: ``no``.

.. inpfile:: time_int.time_stepping_type

   One of ``fixed`` or ``adaptive`` indicating whether a fixed time-stepping
   scheme or an adaptive timestepping scheme is used for simulations. See
   :inpfile:`time_step_control` for more information on max Courant number based
   adaptive time stepping.

.. inpfile:: time_int.realms

   A list of :inpfile:`realms` names. The names entered here must match
   :inpfile:`name` used in the :inpfile:`realms` section. Names listed here not
   found in :inpfile:`realms` list will trigger an error, while realms not
   included in this list but present in :inpfile:`realms` will not be
   initialized and silently ignored. This can cause the code to abort if the
   user attempts to access the specific realm in the :inpfile:`transfers`
   section.

.. _nalu_inp_realm:

computational domain (provided as an Exodus-II mesh), the set of physics
equations that must be solved over this domain, along with the necessary initial
and boundary conditions. Each list entry is a YAML dictionary mapping that is
described in this section of the manual. The key subsections of a Realm entry
in the input file are

=============================== =========================================================================

In addition to the sections mentioned in the table, there are several additional
sections that could be present depending on the specific simulation type and
post-processing options requested by the user. A brief description of these
optional sections are provided below:

================================ ===========================================================================


Common options
``````````````

.. inpfile:: name

   The name of the realm. The name provided here is used in the
   :inpfile:`Time_Integrators` section to determine the time-integration scheme
   used for this computational domain.

.. inpfile:: mesh

   The name of the Exodus-II mesh file that defines the computational domain for
   this realm. Note that only the base name (i.e., without the ``.NPROCS.IPROC``
   suffix) is provided even for simulations using previously decomposed
   mesh/restart files.

.. inpfile:: automatic_decomposition_type

   Used only for parallel runs, this indicates how the a single mesh database
   must be decomposed amongst the MPI processes during initialization. This
   option should not be used if the mesh has already been decomposed by an
   external utility. Possible values are:

   ==========  ==========================================================
   Value       Description
   ==========  ==========================================================
   rcb         recursive coordinate bisection
   rib         recursive inertial bisection
   linear      elements in order first n/p to proc 0, next to proc 1.
   cyclic      elements handed out to id % proc_count
   ==========  ==========================================================

.. inpfile:: activate_aura

   A boolean flag indicating whether an extra element is *ghosted* across the
   processor boundaries. The default value is ``no``.

.. inpfile:: use_edges

   A boolean flag indicating whether edge based discretization scheme is used
   instead of element based schemes. The default value is ``no``.

.. inpfile:: polynomial_order

   An integer value indicating the polynomial order used for higher-order mesh
   simulations. The default value is ``1``. When :inpfile:`polynomial_order` is
   greater than 1, the Realm has the capability to promote the mesh to
   higher-order during initialization.

.. inpfile:: solve_frequency

   An integer value indicating how often this realm is solved during time
   integration. The default value is ``1``.

.. inpfile:: support_inconsistent_multi_state_restart

   A boolean flag indicating whether restarts are allowed from files where the
   necessary field states are missing. A typical situation is when the
   simulation is restarted using second-order time integration but the restart
   file was created using first-order time integration scheme.

.. inpfile:: activate_memory_diagnostic

   A boolean flag indicating whether memory diagnostics are activated during
   simulation. Default value is ``no``.

.. inpfile:: balance_nodes

   simulations. See also :inpfile:`balance_node_iterations` and
   :inpfile:`balance_nodes_target`.

.. inpfile:: balance_node_iterations

   The frequency at which node rebalancing is performed. Default value is ``5``.

.. inpfile:: balance_node_target

   The target balance ratio. Default value is ``1.0``.


Equation Systems
````````````````

.. inpfile:: equation_systems

   ``equation_systems`` subsection defines the physics equation sets that are
   solved for this realm and the linear solvers used to solve the different
   linear systems.

.. note::

   The variable in the :inpfile:`equation_systems` subsection are prefixed with
   ``equation_systems.name`` but only the variable name after the period should
   appear in the input file.

.. inpfile:: equation_systems.name

   A string indicating the name used in log messages etc.

.. inpfile:: equation_systems.max_iterations

   The maximum number of non-linear iterations performed during a timestep that
   couples the different equation systems.

.. inpfile:: equation_systems.solver_system_specification

   A mapping containing ``field_name: linear_solver_name`` that determines the
   linear solver used for solving the linear system. Example:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      solver_system_specification:
        pressure: solve_continuity
        enthalpy: solve_scalar
        velocity: solve_scalar

   The above example indicates that the linear systems for the enthalpy and
   momentum (velocity) equations are solved by the linear solver corresponding
   to the tag ``solve_scalar`` in the :inpfile:`linear_systems` entry, whereas
   the continuity equation system (pressure Poisson solve) should be solved
   using the linear solver definition corresponding to the tag
   ``solve_continuity``.

.. inpfile:: equation_systems.systems

   A list of equation systems to be solved within this realm. Each entry is a
   YAML mapping with the key corresponding to a pre-defined equation system name
   that contains additional parameters governing the solution of this equation
   set. The predefined equation types are

   =====================  ===========================================================
   Equation system        Description
   =====================  ===========================================================
   LowMachEOM             Low-Mach Momentum and Continuity equations

   MassFraction           Mass Fraction
   MixtureFraction        Mixture Fraction
   MeshDisplacement       Arbitrary Mesh Displacement
   =====================  ===========================================================

   An example of the equation system definition for ABL precursor simulations is
   shown below:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      # Equation systems example for ABL precursor simulations
      systems:
        - LowMachEOM:
            name: myLowMach
            max_iterations: 1
            convergence_tolerance: 1.0e-5
        - TurbKineticEnergy:
            name: myTke
            max_iterations: 1
            convergence_tolerance: 1.0e-2
        - Enthalpy:
            name: myEnth
            max_iterations: 1
            convergence_tolerance: 1.0e-2

Initial conditions
``````````````````

.. inpfile:: initial_conditions

   The ``initial_conditions`` sub-sections defines the conditions used to
   initialize the computational fields if they are not provided via the mesh
   file. Two types of field initializations are currently possible:

   - ``constant`` - Initialize the field with a constant value throughout the domain;

   - ``user_function`` - Initialize the field with a pre-defined user function.

   The snippet below shows an example of both options available to initialize
   the various computational fields used for ABL simulations. In this example,
   the pressure and turbulent kinetic energy fields are initialized using a
   constant value, whereas the velocity field is initialized by the user
   function ``boundary_layer_perturbation`` that imposes sinusoidal fluctations
   over a velocity field to trip the flow.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      initial_conditions:
        - constant: ic_1
          target_name: [fluid_part]
          value:
            pressure: 0.0
            turbulent_ke: 0.1

        - user_function: ic_2
          target_name: [fluid_part]
          user_function_name:
            velocity: boundary_layer_perturbation
          user_function_parameters:
            velocity: [1.0,0.0075398,0.0075398,50.0,8.0]

.. inpfile:: initial_conditions.constant

   This input parameter serves two purposes: 1. it indicates the *type*
   (``constant``), and 2. provides the custom *name* for this condition. In
   addition to the :inpfile:`initial_conditions.target_name` this section
   requires another entry ``value`` that contains the mapping of ``(field_name,
   value)`` as shown in the above example.

.. inpfile:: initial_conditions.user_function

   Indicates that this block of YAML input must be parsed as input for a user
   defined function.

.. inpfile:: initial_conditions.target_name

   A list of element blocks (*parts*) where this initial condition must be
   applied.

Boundary Conditions
```````````````````

.. inpfile:: boundary_conditions

   This subsection of the physics Realm contains a list of boundary conditions
   that must be used during the simulation. Each entry of this list is a YAML
   mapping entry with the key of the form ``<type>_boundary_condition`` where
   the available types are:

     - ``inflow``
     - ``open`` -- Outflow BC
     - ``wall``
     - ``symmetry``
     - ``periodic``
     - ``non_conformal`` -- e.g., BC across sliding mesh interfaces
     - ``overset`` -- overset mesh assembly description

All BC types require :inpfile:`bc.target_name` that contains a list of side sets
where the specified BC is to be applied. Additional information necessary for
certain BC types are provided by a sub-dictionary with the key
``<type>_user_data:`` that contains the parameters necessary to initialize a
specific BC type.

.. inpfile:: bc.target_name

   A list of side set part names where the given BC type must be applied. If a
   single string value is provided, it is converted to a list internally during
   input file processing phase.

Inflow Boundary Condition
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: yaml

   - inflow_boundary_condition: bc_inflow
     target_name: inlet
     inflow_user_data:
       velocity: [0.0,0.0,1.0]

Open Boundary Condition
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: yaml

   - open_boundary_condition: bc_open
     target_name: outlet
     open_user_data:
       velocity: [0,0,0]
       pressure: 0.0

Wall Boundary Condition
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. inpfile:: bc.wall_user_data

   This subsection contains specifications as to whether wall models are used,
   or how to treat the velocity at the wall when there is mesh motion.

The following input file snippet shows an example of using an ABL wall function at the
terrain during ABL simulations. See :ref:`theory_abl_wall_function` for more
details on the actual implementation.

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Wall boundary condition example for ABL terrain modeling
   - wall_boundary_condition: bc_terrain
     target_name: terrain
     wall_user_data:
       velocity: [0,0,0]
       use_abl_wall_function: yes
       heat_flux: 0.0
       roughness_height: 0.2
       gravity_vector_component: 3
       reference_temperature: 300.0

The entry :inpfile:`gravity_vector_component` is an integer that
specifies the component of the gravity vector, defined in
:inpfile:`solution_options.gravity`, that should be used in the
definition of the Monin-Obukhov length scale calculation.  The
entry :inpfile:`reference_temperature` is the reference temperature
used in calculation of the Monin-Obukhov length scale. 

When there is mesh motion involved the wall boundary must specify a user
function to determine relative velocity at the surface.

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Wall boundary specification with mesh motion
   - wall_boundary_condition: bc_cylinder
     target_name: cylinder_wall
     wall_user_data:
       user_function_name:
         velocity: wind_energy
       user_function_string_parameters:
         velocity: [cylinder]

The misnomer ``wind_energy`` is a pre-defined *user function* that provides the
correct velocity at the wall accounting for relative mesh motion with respect to
fluid and doesn't specifically deal with any wind energy simulation. The
``user_function_string_parameters`` contains a YAML mapping of fields, e.g.
velocity, to the list of *names* provided in the :inpfile:`soln_opts.mesh_motion`
entry in the :inpfile:`solution_options` section.

Example of wall boundary with a custom user function for temperature at the wall

.. code-block:: yaml

   - wall_boundary_condition: bc_6
     target_name: surface_6
     wall_user_data:
       user_function_name:
        temperature: steady_2d_thermal

Symmetry Boundary Condition
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Requires no additional input other than :inpfile:`bc.target_name`.

.. code-block:: yaml

   - symmetry_boundary_condition: bc_top
      target_name: top
      symmetry_user_data:


Periodic Boundary Condition
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Unlike the other BCs described so far, the parameter :inpfile:`bc.target_name`
behaves differently for the periodic BC. This parameter must be a list
containing exactly two entries: the boundary face pair where periodicity is
enforced. The nodes on these planes must coincide after translation in the
direction of periodicity. This BC also requires a :inpfile:`periodic_user_data`
section that specifies the search tolerance for locating node pairs.

.. inpfile:: periodic_user_data

   .. code-block:: yaml

      - periodic_boundary_condition: bc_east_west
          target_name: [east, west]
          periodic_user_data:
            search_tolerance: 0.0001

Non-Conformal Boundary
++++++++++++++++++++++

Like the periodic BC, the parameter :inpfile:`bc.target_name` must be a list
with exactly two entries that specify the boundary plane pair forming the
non-conformal boundary.

.. code-block:: yaml

   - non_conformal_boundary_condition: bc_left
     target_name: [surface_77, surface_7]
     non_conformal_user_data:
       expand_box_percentage: 10.0

Material Properties
```````````````````

.. inpfile:: material_properties

   The section provides the properties required for various physical quantities
   during the simulation. A sample section used for simulating ABL flows is shown below

   .. code-block:: yaml

.. inpfile:: output.output_data_base_name

   The name of the output Exodus-II database. Can specify a directory relative
   to the run directory, e.g., ``out/nalu_results.e``. The directory will be
   created automatically if one doesn't exist. Default: ``output.e``

.. inpfile:: output.output_frequency

   Nalu will write the output file every ``output_frequency`` timesteps. Note
   that currently there is no option to output results at a specified simulation
   time. Default: ``1``.

.. inpfile:: output.output_start

   Nalu will start writing output past the ``output_start`` timestep. Default: ``0``.

.. inpfile:: output.output_forced_wall_time

   Force output at a specified *wall-clock time* in seconds.

.. inpfile:: output.output_node_set

   Boolean flag indicating whether nodesets, if present, should be output to the
   output file along with element blocks.

.. inpfile:: output.compression_level

   Integer value indicating the compression level used. Default: ``0``.

.. inpfile:: output.output_variables

   A list of field names to be output to the database. The field variables can

   from a previous simulation. This requires that the :inpfile:`mesh` be a
   restart file with all the fields necessary for the equation sets defined in
   the :inpfile:`equation_systems.systems`. Nalu will restart from the closest
   time available in the :inpfile:`mesh` to ``restart_time``. The timesteps
   available in a restart file can be examined by looking at the ``time_whole``
   variable using the ``ncdump`` utility.

   .. note::

      The restart database used for restarting a simulation is the
      :inpfile:`mesh` parameter. The :inpfile:`restart_data_base_name
      <restart.restart_data_base_name>` parameter is used exclusively for
      outputs.

.. inpfile:: restart.restart_frequency
