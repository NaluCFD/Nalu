Invoking Nalu - Command-line options
------------------------------------

Nalu's runtime behavior can be controlled by using several command line input
options during invocation. Users can invoke ``-h`` to determine the
various options available.

.. program:: naluX

.. option:: -h, --help

   Print the help message describing all Nalu options and exit

.. option:: -i, --input-deck

   Use the filename provided as the input file. If this option is not provided,
   :program:`naluX` will attempt to load a file called :file:`nalu.i` in the
   current working directory as the input file.

.. option:: -o, --log-file

   The log file where the output generated by Nalu is directed to. If no file is
   provided, then :program:`naluX` will use the base name of the Nalu input file
   with the extension ``.log`` as the output file. For example, if
   :program:`naluX` was invoked as ``naluX -i ABL.neutral.i`` then the output
   will be redirected to a file named :file:`ABL.neutral.log`. Note that the
   file is overwritten if it already exists.

.. option:: -v, --version

   Print the Nalu version string.

.. option:: -p, --pprint

   Enable parallel printing from all MPI ranks.

.. option:: -D, --debug

   Enable verbose debug printing to log file.
